# Learning Journal Class 10

The chocolate pizza assignment was a good chance for me to get my hands on some CSS from a less creative standpoint. It was much less obnoxious to have something put in front of me and be told to build it than trying to design myself and definitely helped me connect the fact that we aren't designers. It was also a good chance for me to work with another member of our class and network a bit with him and a good break from logic for the most part. I feel like between me and Mitchell we managed to create a pretty solid final product complete with list functionality.
