# Learning Journal Class 9

So far I feel pretty strong on the logic side of the course and I understand the CSS/HTML side fairly well also but as with anything extra practice is never a bad thing when it comes to learning a new subject so I'll continue to push myself to use CSS to make my projects look interesting within the boundries of what is required on each assignment. I'm glad to be done with the salmon cookies assignment.
