# Learning Journal Day 4

Practicing use of arrays as arguments for functions in pair programming was a useful way to see the possible uses for building a function. The pair programming exercise gave me an opportunity to experiment with functions a bit to make them reusable for more than just the already written questions but also as a function to ask any number of questions and compare them to any number of answers with any number of possible responses to given answers.

I'm also looking forward to messing with CSS a bit more and seeing what I can produce with the use of floats and absolute/relative positioning.
