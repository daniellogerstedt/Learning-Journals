# Learning Journal Class 15

So far the project team I'm working with has gotten a significant bit of work toward our MVP finished without many hiccups, it'll be nice to work through project week and see what kind of issues we come across and how we solve them. For now though I'm happy with the basic encryption system I built over the weekend to get our apps logic started out strong and am interested to see what the final product comes out as.
