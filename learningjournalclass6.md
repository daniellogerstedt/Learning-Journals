# Learning Journal Class 6

working with objects has been interesting and challenging but I seem to be having trouble getting any of the document commands to actually cooperate and find most of my attempts are giving me type errors of some kind. I'll have to see if I can have someone get eyes on my code to attempt to solve the issue I'm having because I'm failing to spot where the issue is.

Other than that the use of objects has definitely made it easier to build functions around more real world concepts like a store.
